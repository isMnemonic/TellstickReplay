Introduction

In home automation there are several good projects going on and with commercial products available there are few functions being left, with a few exceptions. First, most of
the projects are rarely adapted to be responsive for mobile devices. Products such as Fibaro for Z-Wave is expensive and other such as Tellstick Net/Duo/Basic does not support
flexible scheduling and also in comparison to Z-Wave does not offer two way communication in the protocol. myZai is aiming to collaborate the best of these two worlds.



myZai : my Z-Wave Automation Interface

This project goal is to be a local service to use either locally, remotly or both using own your
own hardware and prefered operating system. myZai will come in different sets:

* myZai Core : fundamental functionality for communicating with Z-Wave devices via Razberry controller.

* myZai Service : local and remote handling for clients to communicate with the Core.

* myZai App : Smartphone based app for easy access to control all functions of the myZai Service and Core.


Custom Hardware
myZai is primarly running on ARM hardware due to its being developed for the Raspberry Pi but since its running
on JAVA it will run on all available platforms JAVA can support. For custom hardware this is
