Introduction

Telldus is a small electronics company whom develops the core product Tellstick and which comes in three different versions:
Tellstick Basic, Tellstick Duo and Tellstick NET. The all have in common is that they can communicate with devices on the
frequency of 433Mhz and commonly used for home automation products.


Tellstick Replay¡

This project goal is to be an alternative service to use these three products either locally, remotly or both using own your
own hardware and prefered operating system. Tellstick Replay¡ will come in different sets:

* Tellstick Replay¡ Core : fundamental functionality for communicating with Tellstick devices.

* Tellstick Replay¡ Service : local and remote handling for clients to communicate with the Core.

* Tellstick Replay¡ App : Android based app for easy access to control all functions of the Tellstick Replay¡ Service and Core.

Hardware Projects
Most of the products available for home automation are lightbulbs and electrical switches the most common and comes in a few
formats aswell. Compiler will be developing its own hardware to use in joncuntion with Tellstick devices. Plans are for a
custom weather station featuring basic light/sun radiation recognition and tempature measurements.
